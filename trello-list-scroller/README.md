# Trello List Scroller (TLS)

Script allows you to navigate to Trello-board and automatically scroll to
the needed list by specifying it's name in query-string.

You can then save the prepared URI in Bookmarks or use it directly from
adress bar (via history search in your browser).

Try this link, for example:

- [Trello Test Board](https://trello.com/b/WCQS9DQm?scrollToList=Stiletto)
- `https://trello.com/b/WCQS9DQm?scrollToList=Stiletto`
